# Emojicrypt < Codex Z

A little ruby side project I wrote in my 7th week of learning to code at Makers. It currently consists of a function that can convert a base-10 number into any base system, given the symbol set. Most importantly, it can convert base-10 numbers into base-emoji (currently equivalent to base-2339, but subject to change)


## Expected input and output examples 

-base: 10, base-10-number-input: 905 => "905"
-base: 2, base-10-number-input: 16 => "10000"
-base: 16, base-10-number-input: 64206 => "FACE"
-base: emojis(2339), base-10-number-input: 1_000_000 => "🤷🏻‍♂️🥢"

## Next steps

- To learn more about encryption and encrypt entire messages using base emoji
- To have fun

## Techs used

Ruby
Test-driven using RSpec

## About Codex Z

Codex Z is a series of repos that deal with more abstract mathematical/logical problems and less real world logic, written from scratch by me, Zi.
